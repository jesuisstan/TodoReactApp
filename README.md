# TodoReactApp
### Getting Started with React
This is my very first WebApp. It is about getting started with React.\
This simple web application allows you to create your own todos list and manage with each todo.\
The project demonstrates basic knowledgement on working with html, css, React, JSX, useState hook.\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
